# AES-using-VHDL
Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) Algorithm is implementd using VHDL. AES is capable of encrypting 128, 192 and 256 bits of data and results an Cipher text of same size as input. Depending on the size of input plain text the number of rounds in the algorithm changes. It has 10, 12 and 14 rounds for 128, 192 and 256-bit input plain text respectively.
Along with the input plain text it also has a
